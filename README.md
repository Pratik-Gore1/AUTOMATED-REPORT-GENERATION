This project demonstrates automated report generation using Python, as required for Task 2 of the internship. The main objective of this program is to read data from an external file, analyze the data, and generate a structured and formatted PDF report. By automating the reporting process, the program reduces manual effort and ensures consistent and accurate presentation of information.

The program reads student performance data from a CSV file, which is a commonly used file format for storing tabular data. Python’s pandas library is used to load the file and organize the data into a structured format that allows easy access and manipulation of rows and columns. This approach simplifies data handling and prepares the data for analysis.

Before generating the report, the program performs basic data analysis on the input file. It calculates key statistical values such as the average marks, highest marks, and lowest marks. These calculations provide meaningful insights into the overall performance represented in the dataset and form the analytical summary of the report.

Once the analysis is completed, the program uses the ReportLab library to generate a PDF report. ReportLab provides tools for creating professional looking PDF documents programmatically. The report includes a clear title, a summary section displaying the calculated statistics, and a neatly formatted table containing the original data from the file.

The tabular representation of the data improves readability and allows users to easily compare individual records. Spacing and formatting elements are applied to ensure the report is clean and visually organized. The final PDF file is generated automatically and saved to the local system.

Overall, this project demonstrates effective file handling, basic data analysis, and automated document generation using Python. It fulfills all the requirements of the internship task by combining data processing with professional report creation in a practical and efficient manner.
